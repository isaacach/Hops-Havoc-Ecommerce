      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my little corner of the internet! My name is Isaac, and I have a deep passion for the art and science of homebrewing beer.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started as a curious hobby quickly turned into a lifelong journey of exploration, creativity, and craftsmanship. There's something magical about taking simple ingredients like water, malt, hops, and yeast, and transforming them into a drink that brings people together and tells a story.

      <p>
        I love experimenting with different styles and techniques, whether it's brewing a classic IPA, crafting a smooth stout, or diving into the complex world of sours. Every batch is an opportunity to learn, refine, and share the joy of brewing with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the brewing process, I enjoy connecting with fellow enthusiasts, exchanging tips, and sharing the fruits of my labor with friends and family. To me, homebrewing is more than just making beerâ€”it's a way of building community and celebrating creativity.
